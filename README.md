# RankersHub Clone (React + Material-UI)

A React-based clone of the **Rankershub.ai** landing page, recreated using **Material-UI (MUI)** components and styling. This project replicates the design and layout of the original site, including hero section, services, perks, testimonials, footer, and navigation—demonstrating a clean, responsive UI using modern React best practices.
